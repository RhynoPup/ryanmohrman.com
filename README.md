# Ryan Mohrman's Personal Website

This personal website is designed, built by, and managed by me as a place to share my current projects and to let people get to know me.

## Design
The initial design is based on [StartBootstrap's Creative Theme](https://startbootstrap.com/themes/creative/), and large modifications were made to make the website my own. The biggest change currently is to the portfolio section which now uses Bootstrap4's card example.

```html
<div class="col-lg-6 mb-4">
  <div class="card h-100">
    <a href="https://github.com/RhynoPup/ryanmohrman.com"><img class="card-img-top" src="/assets/img/personal-website.jpg" alt="Personal wbsite preview"></a>
    <div class="card-body">
      <h4 class="card-title">
        <a href="https://github.com/RhynoPup/ryanmohrman.com">Personal Website</a>
      </h4>
      <p class="card-text">The redesign of my personal website (this site). Based on a bootstrap theme from startbootstrap, I used Jekyll and 
        githubpages to build and host this website. More projects, a blog, and additional content will be added as time allows, but this project 
        has been a fun way to brush up on my design skills.
